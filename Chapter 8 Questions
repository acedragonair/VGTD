Waterfall
Choosing a waterfall program would require the schedule to be more strict an would be hard to revise if a person requires more time to do a certain part. It would so require for a more decriptive and and specific overwiew of the whole project.This inturn will result in more time planning therefore, will require more time and resources. This will also require steps which will hinder different part of the production team.

Agile
The positive side of agilE planning is that the game does will not be constricted to a sigular path and is more flexible. This can increase the game quality being able to recieve imput from other sources.The negative about this method is that it the schedule will need to include more time for revisions.

Scrum
This is the approach I would most likely used due to the fact that it is the best for small groups. This method fits the schedule perfectly due to the fact that it is self organized. The schedule is based on a 30 -day time frame therefore it it is the perfect approach to this game where everyone is task with different aspect all led by one manager.

Extreme Programming
This method will most likely be more of a hindrance du to the fact that is will require for everyone to work on projects co-operatively. This can hinder the time process and might cause conflict with the scheduling. On ther other hand, people will feel more appretiated and create a better team moral which in turn can potentitally increase the production rate. Also, Pair develoment might make the production quicker having multiple heads tackling problems.
