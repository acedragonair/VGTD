One day a a young mans father disappeared on a full moon but no one knew where he went.

2.1(realtime)
-NPC interaction
-battle engine

2.2(turn based)

-scenes when the character unlock certain areas.
-items to be collected
-character moral choices
-calculation to player power
-battle engine

The core mechanics I chosed for the linear story is real-time mechanic.
this is due to the fact that their is little player input, therefore, the core mechanic can simply operate continuously during the game.

the core mechanics is chose for the second story is turn-base. 
Since, there was alot of story branching in the second story and player input.
this will intrun change the story depending on the players input.

3.1
-compound entity(avatar)

The difficulty would bepercieve difficulty.This is due to the fact that thier is no power system no action the cause the character to experience growth.

3.2
-a multiple compound entities(avatar,inventory,followers)
-any wepon acuired(hatchet,stick)
-wild resources(water,herbs)
-converts (posion food potion)

the difficutly will be a relative difficulty. this means that the difficulty will be scaled as the player proggress through the story.
this will also change as he gain access to diferent abilities and weapons.
